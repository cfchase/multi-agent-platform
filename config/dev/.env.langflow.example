#   Commented   = OPTIONAL

# --- REQUIRED (set at least one LLM provider your flows use) ---

# Langfuse Tracing (auto-populated by generate-config.sh)
# ========================================
# Placeholder values below are replaced with real keys during config setup.
# If not using Langfuse, these placeholders are harmless (invalid keys won't connect).
# Values are auto-synced from .env.langfuse by generate-config.sh.

# Langflow Runtime Configuration
# ========================================
# Env vars exposed as Langflow global variables (accessible by flow components).
# Note: local dev (scripts/dev-langflow.sh) uses a different set without Langfuse vars.
